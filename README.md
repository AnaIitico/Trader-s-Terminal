# `The Purpose of the indicator that I'm building`
This indicator is a Dashboard that displays market information and analytical data on the markets, directly on the broker platform. No need to switch between charts or websites looking at dozens of indicators.

When used combined as a strategy the user gets real-time analysis of market conditions across many markets and this provides a better overall picture of true market conditions.

This is your one-stop-shop to view actionable market data.

# `How to install and use the indicator`
The indicator is proprietary and it's the reason why the code is not released.  It works on several MT4 brokers so it's made for the MT4 Platform.

It's available for lease by contacting me via GitHub message.
